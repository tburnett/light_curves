# light_curves
> This is package being adapted to the `nbdev` environment from my code, from my <a href='https://github.com/tburnett/jupydoc'>github package lat-timing](https://github.com/tburnett/lat-timing) to manage light curves of Fermi-LAT sources.  At the same time, I'm trying to use/adapt my [jupydoc</a> documention package.
