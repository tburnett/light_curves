# The `light_curve` package
> Code for generating fermi-LAT light curves. <a href='https://tburnett.github.io/light_curves/'>link to this document</a>


## Background

This package has code that is being adapted to the [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) environment from [github package lat-timing](https://github.com/tburnett/lat-timing) to manage light curves of Fermi-LAT sources.  

As pointed out there, it is based on a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00140.pdf) by Matthew Kerr, 

And at the same time, I've ported some code from  my [jupydoc](https://github.com/tburnett/jupydoc) documention package to allow enhanced documentation combining Markdown and code. This is demonstrated below.

## Installation
To enable the `nbdev_*` commands, after cloning, in its folder run the command
`pip install -e .`
